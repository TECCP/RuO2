1. Install [SRC_dmft1.1].
[dmft]: To calculate the occupation matrix.

2. Install Hartree-Fock codes. For example,
ifort -o init_sig init_sig.f90
ifort -o mk_kanamori_mf_h mk_kanamori_mf_h.f90
ifort -o mx_occ mx_occ.f90
ifort -o ck_mm ck_mm.f90

[init_sig]: To make the ``zero'' self-energy. Making the input, only once at the first stage.
[mk_kanamori]: To put the Kanamori parametrization into the H(R=0). It prints a hamilt file out, which is the input for [dmft].
[mx_occ]: To mix the occpation matrix, between the old and new iteration.
[ck_mm]: To check the spin magnetic moment. Run only once after convergence.
